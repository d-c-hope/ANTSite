<h4 class="quotesIntro">What the staff said</h4>

<li>"We no longer worry about spelling and grammar"</li>
<li>"It's so much quicker - we spend much more time with the children now rather than filling in paperwork"</li>
<li>"It improved my computer skills - I now feel confident when helping the children with their ICT"</li>
<li>"Without rushing to find paper sheets I can now spend time chatting to parents and carers"</li>


<h4 class="quotesIntro">What the parents and carers said:</h4>
<li>"The paper record sheets ended up chewed and ripped by the time I got to the car. I can now look at the reports at my leisure and I read about what my child has done at a time when I can fully appreciate it"</li>
<li>"I love seeing photos of them regularly, playing and happy at nursery - it makes me feel less guilty knowing that they are enjoying themselves"</li>
<li>"I regularly work away and in the past I felt at a real disadvantage not being able to pick up my child and chat to staff about his development. The emailed reports have totally negated this and I now feel fully involved and I look forward to receiving the reports every day"</li>

<h4 class="quotesIntro">What the management said:</h4>
<li>"Our printing costs have gone down by nearly &pound;2200. We can not believe the difference it has made"</li>
<li>"The admin site is really easy to use - we had lots of assistance when setting it all up, and to be honest it went without a hitch"</li>
<li>"Most day we receive emails from parents/ carers thanking us for the detailed reports/ photographs - it's lovely to hear such positive feedback from something that was so easy to implement"</li>
